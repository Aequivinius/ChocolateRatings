# Data Description

The dataset is taken from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/chocolate-bar-ratings), and describes 1700 bars of chocolate with ratings obtained by the expert and information about producer, bean origin etc. Specifically, for every bar it contains the following information:
* Information about the producer:
  * Name of the producer (for example: **A. Morin**)
  * Location (country) of the producers (**France**)
* Information on the bean:
  * Origin of the bean (in two columns: more specific, e.g. **Quilla**, and broader, e.g. **Venezuela**)
  * Variety of the bean (e.g. **Criollo**)
  ⚠️ Often, this is omitted
* Cacao percentage of the bar
* Review (between 1 and 5) and date of review

# Data Protection

This dataset contains no personal information, neither about the people working for the chocolate producers, nor, more importantly, about the reviewers. Their reviews are anonymously provided, and while this might be detrimental to the quality of the data set, it ensures their privacy. It would be interesting if the data set would also provide anonymised IDs of the reviewers, so that personal preferences of the reviewers could be discovered; but this is not the case.
